Note that this description also works fine just launch it via:

```
	roslaunch kuka_kr5_description test_kr5.launch
```

Its only difference from the **kuka_manipulator_description** package is that it has no plate to use and it also has not such a nice **joint_effort_limit_3** description which seems to be currently quite critik to control the robot in gazebo without trembling efffects....
